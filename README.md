# React Tutorial (Build an Error Log App)

In this tutorial, we are going to build an Error Log Application. The error log application will be an app we can use to record the code errors we encounter and the solutions, so we can use it as a reference when we encounter the same error in the future. This application can be a great aid when you are getting started to help learn to troubleshoot issues, by breaking down the problem in little pieces.

If you have a github account, it would be a good idea to link it to your glitch account so you can commit to github after each step.
